## On my academic profile


My name is  [Vincent Deguin](https://50.open.ac.uk/photography/vincent), I am an Astrophysics PhD student at the Open University and my PhD focus on: 

<p class="emphase">Experimenting with the earliest stages of planet formation</p>

I am particulary interested in understanding the key role that ice (coating interstellar dust grains) plays in that respect (both from a physical and chemical point of view). I have an insatiable appetite for Open Science, that is unfortunately overlooked by the scientific community. This web-site is an attempt to make the outputs of my scientific journey as **open, accesible and reproducible** as possible, and is dived in 3 main sections:

My research outputs, classified by projects, written in a creative and open access format.

```{admonition} Idea for later

- Add span div that appear when the fish in aquarium is hovered.
- Create specific admonitions for each fish type
- Add student fish (floating on his back at surface ^^)

```

I aim to deliver content for **everybody** `interested in Science`, so let me know who you are and I will point you in the right direction. Let me take advantage of those presentation to tell you that this project is very much in **construction**, be mindfull of it.

Teaching is an important part of the life of a researcher and deserve its own book (click on card or individual courses). However, it is a task that is often controlled and managed by heavy administrative bodies. I think, however that every researcher should be given the chance to share his knowledge in a creative and appealing fashion (that is terribly lacking in academia).
