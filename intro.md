## On my academic profile


My name is  [Vincent Deguin](https://50.open.ac.uk/photography/vincent) and I am an Astrophysics PhD student at the Open University (as of 1st of August 2022). My PhD focus on **Experimenting with the earliest stages of planet formation** and I am particulary interested in understanding the key role that ice (coating interstellar dust grains) plays in that respect (both from a physical and chemical point of view). I have an insatiable appetite for Open Science, that is unfortunately overlooked by the scientific community. This web-site is an attempt to make the outputs of my scientific journey as **open, accesible and reproducible** as possible, and is dived in 3 main sections:



::::{grid} 3
:::{grid-item-card}
:link: Research/Research_Main.html
**Research** <span style="float: right">&#10024;</span>
^^^

A place where I intend to share my research outputs in a creative and open access format because, I don' really like to do things "by the book" (especially when they involve paying to publish behind a paywall using a boring template). 

:::
:::{grid-item-card}
:link: Teaching/Teaching_main.html
**Teaching** <span style="float: right">&#128640;</span>
^^^

Teaching material based on what I learned during my scientific journey. Also a plateform where other researcher can come and collaborate to build a better understanding of interdisciplanry science questions (like planet formation for example).

I have never been so keen in keeping my mouth shut, and never used clasical social media plateform (![flag alt >](Docs/Svg_icons/interdiction/twitter_forbidden.png), ![flag alt >](Docs/Svg_icons/interdiction/facebook_forbidden.png), ![flag alt >](Docs/Svg_icons/interdiction/instagram_forbidden.png), ![flag alt >](Docs/Svg_icons/interdiction/linkedin_forbidden.png)) to share my opinions because the format is unadapted, so here they are.

Teaching is an important part of the life of a researcher and deserve its own book (click on card or individual courses). However, it is a task that is often controlled and managed by heavy administrative bodies. I think, however that every researcher should be given the chance to share his knowledge in a creative and appealing fashion (that is terribly lacking in academia).

- **Bitesize**

Small lessons to introduce specific topics that I encounter during my research journey.  
Contributions from other Researcher are welcome and encouraged (Ross) - **Link toward interaction workflow**

- **Practicle**

Some practical tutorials which will accompanied you in producing some material.
