# Project development

## Until now

### As far as I am concerned 

<div class="emphase">
    Notebook 3000
</div>

This plateform is an incredible tool 

<div class="emphase">
    Research Portefolio
</div>

Display my research outputs with a multitude of audiences
- Supervisory teams
- 

**Enhanced reproducibility**

```

- Data is accessible `zenodo` ...
- Code is interactive (`binder`), commentable (`hypotesis`), reproducible(`Github`) ...

Great as a ressource to pass on for futur people involved in a project (cf Postdoc example)

Insert project description + aims (use pictures from touring way)

### For others

- Prepare tutorial to get ready for Jupyter Book
- Create a template book

## To do



## Description



## Aims

Insert here the long term plan of the project

### Other

```{note}
Create a voting system (below accademia - first page) for people to choose a subject that they want to analyse (using public or personal data ?) and to create a specific book for it. Scientific collaboration with the general public towards subjects of public interests.

Experts from different fields can collaborate towards solving the questions from the topic while producing tools for the people to perform further analysis 

- Measuring climate change,
- Biodiversite sur le bassin d'Arcachon (pour toi le JIM)
- ...
```




## Business idea

In order to further developp this project but also because science doesn't pay much (especialy when you do it "out of the box"), it seems important to develop potential income solutions:

```{note} Free Version

The main objective of the project is to change the mentality of the scientific community and **a free version must always be available** and favoured in most of the cases.

```

**Description**

A simple template book plus some help to setting it up and resolve any primary issues.


**Target**
- Students (Master, PhD)
- Early career researcher

**Include**

- 1 template book tailored for research (give link)
- 1 setting-up session (1/2 a day)
- 1 subsequent session (2h) to resolve any potential issue

**Outcome**


:::

**Cheap plan** 
^^^
**Description**

A more advanced book including some of the previous scientific outputs of the researcher (few hundreds Â£ depending on the work needed). help to setting it up and resolve any primary issues.


**Target**
- Senior Researcher 
- General public
    
**Include**

- 1 template book tailored for research (give link)
- 1 setting-up session (1/2 a day)
- 1 subsequent session (2h) to resolve any potential issue
+ Tailord accompaniement to include previous research (or objectives)

## Elsewhere

### Other tools on the market

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), looks more professional, more versatil (ie R, Julia), but more complicated and code intensive, less accessible.

- [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/), various tools to make research more open:
