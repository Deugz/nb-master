My name is  [Vincent Deguin](https://50.open.ac.uk/photography/vincent) and I am an Astrophysics PhD student at the Open University (as of 1st of August 2022). My PhD focus on **Experimenting with the earliest stages of planet formation** and I am particulary interested in understanding the key role that ice (coating interstellar dust grains) plays in that respect (both from a physical and chemical point of view). I have an insatiable appetite for Open Science, that is unfortunately overlooked by the scientific community. This web-site is an attempt to make the outputs of my scientific journey as **open, accesible and reproducible** as possible, and is dived in 3 main sections:

A place where I intend to share my research outputs

Teaching material based on what I learned during my Scientific journey.

I have never been so keen in keeping my mouth shut, mostly when what I want to say is related to injustice. The Scientific world is full of it so here is a place where I will share my say.

### Other

```{note}
Purpose here would be to create a voting system (pay ?) for people to choose a subject that they want to analyse (using public or personal data ?) and to create a specific book for it. Scientific collaboration with the general public towards subjects of public interests

- Measuring climate change,
- Biodiversite sur le bassin d'Arcachon (pour toi le JIM)
- ...
```

## The Science For The People project

### Description

- Empowering researcher to self-publish themselves.
- Produce an open and transparent peer review process.


Include diagram to  explain the project 
(margin toolbox + explain)

### Want to help ?

- Produce a type of **form**, to recover the opinion of people regarding the web-site
- Create a typee page (button) to welcome contribution

### Business idea

<div class="emphase">
    Blog 2.0 - fitted for Research
</div>



```{warning}
**Plan**
- Put online w/ Astra help (8th Aug) - with PhD, Postdoc
- Link between all those notebooks
- Share with OU people and close ones
    - Ross
    - Giulia
    - Tom
    - Pierre
    - Antoine
    - Benoit
    - Le Bro
    - More ?
- Improve (work on Phd all week)
    - Create and implement french dialogue notes
    - Implement utterance ...
    - Create opinion google form
- Share with wider Friend
    - Ask for comment
```



In order to further developp this project but also because science doesn't pay much (especialy when you do it "out of the box"), it seems important to develop potential income solutions:

```{note} Free Version

The main objective of the project is to change the mentality of the scientific community and **a free version must always be available** and favoured in most of the cases.

```

#### Other tools on the market

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), looks more professional, more versatil (ie R, Julia), but more complicated and code intensive, less accessible.
