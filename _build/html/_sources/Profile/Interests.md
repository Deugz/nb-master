In space, ice is present in many environments. My Research focuses on the first one, Interstellar Dust and their evolution within protoplanetary disks.

Dust is <span class="hovertext" data-hover="found everywhere">ubiquitus</span> in space. They are produced by Stars as sub-&micro;m grains made of either carbon or silicate and are subsequently dispersed by the solar winds in the <span class="hovertext" data-hover="InterStellar Medium">ISM</span>. In the high vacuum of space, they provide a surface for <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Ok with those concepts ? if not go and check Astronomy 101">atoms and small molecules</span> to stick and react, and are hence the main <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Definition">catalyst</span> of chemical reactions in the Universe. When the dust is embeded within <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Gigantic clouds with high density (?) and low temperature (20 Kelvin)">Molecular Clouds</span> ({numref}`JWST1`), they are protected from <span class="hovertext" data-hover="like cosmic rays, that destroys the forming molecular layers of the dust">radiation</span> and an <strong>icy layer</strong> can form around the dust grain. 
Molecular Clouds are the birth place of Stars, and all those tiny &micro;m interstellar dust grains (and gas) contained within the cloud will be the building blocks of all the <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Planets, Moons, Comets ...">solar system bodies</span>.
    
Interesting subject to study, don't you think ? 
    
**Note**: {numref}`dust1` is actually not an interstellar dust grain but an interplanetary grain (easier to catch - with the Stardust mission)

Star formation is a complicated process that is not yet perfectly understood. They are the result of the <span class="hovertext" data-hover="effondrement sous le poids de la gravite, ie ...">gravitational collapse</span> of a dense part of a molecular cloud (referred as clump). 
    
Protoplanetary Disks are a byproduct of star formation. They contain both Dust and Gas (ratio of 1:99) and in a time scale of a few million years will result in a solar system like our own...
