# My Entrepreneurship Journey

**Based on OU course**



I use this page to take notes from the above OU course

## Week 1

### Am I an Entrepreneur ?

<p class="emphase">Entrepreneurs are those persons (business owners) who seek to generate value, through the creation or expansion of economic activity, by identifying and exploiting new products, processes or markets.</p>

```

<p class="emphase">Entrepreneurs are defined by their actions (not the size of organization they work for*). They create and/or exploit change for profit, by innovating, accepting risk and moving resources to areas of higher return.</p>

<p class="emphase">Enterprise is an alternative term for a business or firm, as in the widely used term ‘small and medium sized enterprise’ (SME). They include ‘social enterprises’ which are trading organisations that serve a primary social purpose, and which can take a variety of legal forms….</p>

```{note}
*An intrapreneur is a salaried employee in a larger company and the profits and risks of their work go to their employer.

(Blundel, et al., 2018, p. 4)

### What is the big idea ?

There are many potential sources of ideas. Some fairly common examples include:

```{note}

Use space to speak about my own business idea

```

- **Spotting an opportunity** (e.g. a gap in the market)


- **Experiencing a problem and looking for a solution for it** (e.g. an invention)


- **Being able to do something that others can’t** (e.g. using a talent)


- **Being prepared to do something others don’t want to or can’t do** (e.g. cleaning)


- **Having something that others might need or want** (e.g. investing in plant or machinery for hire)



### Invention, innovation and enterprise

Writers on enterprise tend to differentiate between **innovation and enterprise**. Not everyone who comes up with an innovative new idea, like an inventor, is an entrepreneur. The entrepreneur is the person who turns an innovative idea into either commercial ends or, in the case of a *social entrepreneur, solves a particular social problem*. Sometimes they may be one and the same person, but not always

#### Discovery skills

| Skills | Definition | Do I have it ? |
|---|---|---|
|Observing|actively noticing, watching, listening, perceiving, experiencing something|yes|
|Questioning|asking relevant questions||
|Curiosity|the behaviour that causes you to ask questions and seek answers to why, how, where, when things happen as they do|yes|
|Connectivity|linking objects, people, concepts, data, ideas etc. to see what results - or in the case of computing linking devices to each other and the internet|yes|
|Associating|making connections between one thing and another - for example possible alternative solutions to a problem; possible ways to satisfy a need or want|yes|
|Incubation|the process of developing ideas or solutions to a point where they have form|yes|
|Creativity and innovation|the production of a new idea, solution, product, service or business which may be new to the world, an improvement on something, or provides access to a new market.|yes|

#### Ideas all around us

- **Simplifying what is there**

- **Adding to what is there**

- **Emphasising different attributes**

- **Making something available in one place that otherwise customers would have to seek in many different places.**

***

As a word of caution though, although you may perceive things in one way and can see a new approach, this does not necessarily mean others will share your vison, or view your idea as better. It is likely that changes and adaptation will happen

### Solving problems and seeing opportunities

#### Design thinking

#### Framing

This framing technique works where there is a clear sense of what needs to be achieved. It means thinking about:

- How people are going to use the things you plan to make
- How you will create value and, critically, for whom.



```{figure} Docs/Design_Frame.jpg

```

- **Discover**: this phase is intended to provide more insight into the problem or challenge being addressed. Hence this opens up thinking.
- **Define**: in this phase the intention is to focus upon specific areas to identify priorities, test assumptions and feasibility
- **Develop**: once more, thinking is broadened out to highlight all potential solutions, prototypes and concepts that can be tested
- **Deliver**: in this phase, evaluation of alternatives is designed to filter down to solutions that will be finalised and produced.

#### Learning from mistakes

## Week 2 

- **Delivering the business**

Are you able to produce something that can be monetised in some way? That is to say, can you consistently meet the demand for a product or service that others consider worth paying for (or making use of)? If you can’t, your business won’t even get off the ground.

- **Running the business**

Running a business or, in other words, fulfilling the functions and obligations required of an organisation properly, observing the law, and at the same time, meeting the expectations of your stakeholders (customers, shareholders, suppliers and so on) is also essential. If you fall foul of the law or regulator (if appropriate), or you consistently fall short of customer expectations, it won’t take long for your business to go under.

- **Getting the business**.

This is your ability to find, supply and keep on getting new sales, contracts and customers. Again, with no future income streams, you will deplete your initial capital and resources very soon, along with your ability to meet obligations to your creditors.

### Starting your business

#### Motivation and context

- **Reflexion on my own motivations**:
