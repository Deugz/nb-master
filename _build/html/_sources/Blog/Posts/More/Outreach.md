# Outreach

<p class="emphase2"> & Public Engagement </p>

***

Outreach and public engagement is a <strong>core mission</strong> of every scientists.

```{note}

I have based this blog post on the following [Source](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0psqp2ph29pv2pl/AABFCT9T2rS7fRyQxIL0pwqWa?dl=0)

<p class="emphase"> Public engagement describes the myriad of ways in which the activity and benefits of higher education and research can be shared with the public. Engagement is by definition a <strong>two-way process</strong> involving interaction and listening, with the goal of generating <strong>mutual benefit</strong>. <br><br> NCCPE (National Coordinating centre for Public Engagement), UK </p>

## How I am told to do it

### Identify your audience

<p class="emphase">Identify a target public group/community and think about what your target group might be interested in and link your research to this. Will your target group be able to answer the question: <em>"How does this matter to me" </em></p>

```{admonition} "How does this matter to me" 

Does it really have to be ?

```

### Reach

<p class="emphase"> How can you reach your target group and what do you feel comfortable doing: Teaching? Performing? Speaking in public? Running a workshop? Designing a ressource/class/audio-visual asset? Or maybe you would like to <strong>try something new</strong>? Get outside of the box?</p>

```{admonition} What do you feel comfortable doing 

Myself, very little, but if I bring around multiple people, each with their own skills, we can work together around the same goal. The missing piece is a single plateform where all of us can implement our multicultural inputs.

```

### Deliver

<p class="emphase"> Do you have any hobbies that you could incorporate into your Public Engagement activity ?</p>

```{note}

Web-development

```

<p class="emphase"> Activities you,ve heard about - do you find any of them interesting? Would you like to try your hand at them?</p>


```{note}

There is many interesting activities developped. The main issue is to let people know about them, sorted appropriately with guidance on how to access them.
