# Roadmap

````{margin} 
```{warning}
Main goal is **finish my PhD**
- Deadline: **June 2023**
```
````

This digital space where you have just set foot, is an **experiment** whose aim is to challenge the current *scientific publication system* by offering a creative alternative. There is a long way to go to get there though, and for the time being, it is a collection of `Jupyter Books`. They are canvas to share my research outputs and explore the tools available to make it `Findable, Accesible, Interoperable and Reusable`.

#### Workflow

##### Science

Science is all about **Data**. Every scientific project involved the generation and interpretation of one or multiple datasets. They can be of many types and shape ...

```{image} Docs/workflow1.png
:alt: workflow1
:width: 800px
```

##### Processing Tools

**Python**

Python is a programming language


##### Anaconda

**Jupyter Notebook**

 Combine Python with markdown

**Jupyter Lab**

terminal

**Jupyter Book**

[...]



**Github**

Version control




#### Skeleton

The following image is a poster I presented at a conference [Open Dialogues Across Physics and Astronomy](https://open-dialogues-phys-and-astro.web.app/) in September 2022 related to the **Science for the Peopple** project

## Project aims

### Until PhD submission

<p class="emphase">Finish the Thesis</p>

Is the main **goal**, and there is still a lot to do

- Data Reduction (link notebook) 
- Data Processing
- ...

I am planning to write my thesis in Word but during the final year of my PhD, I will keep populating this web-site with my research outputs and use it as a tool to discus the results with my supervision team (and collaborators).

This web-site can Help! (cf benefices section in PhD page - (make link))

<p class="emphase">Notebook and supervision</p>

Notes are taken using `markdown` within the PhD folder and are uploaded weekly on Github, prior to my meeting with Anita

**Supervisory team needs to be involved for Peer Review** (Agreed!). 

- Innovative approach
- Continuous feedback workflow
- Open, inclusive ...
- Easy and fun!

#### Benefits

```{note}
Include PhD  benefits section
```


<p class="emphase">Sprinkle the Teaching material</p>

Unfolding a Research question requires diving into a lot of complex scientific topics and I will sprinkle the [Teaching](Teaching pages) as I go along. However, the ariane thread related to planet formation span across multiple Scientific fields. For example, I study the formation of planets from a *bottom-up* approach, taking the initial material present in protoplanetary disks, interstellar dust grains and understand how they aggregate to form bigger bodies and eventually planets. Other Scientists take the opposite approach, recovering meteorites and studying them to understand where do they come frome and what is their formation history (top to bottom). Even though we are trying to solve the same question, our background knowledge, investigation techniques and basic language is completely different and it makes it hard sometimes to understand each others.       

<p class="emphase">Community building</p>

Idealy I would like to build a community like those ones:

- [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/)
    - [Pythia project](https://projectpythia.org/)
    
- [Ncar](https://ncar.ucar.edu/)

### Once PhD submitted


In the future I intend to pursue a Web-development course (le Wagon - 2 month)

**Coding school, le `Wagon` (inspiration Benjamin code)
- 2 month
- Needs finance (crowdsourcing ?)
- Transform the Canvas book



Build a community
- Involve people using the [Teaching](link) section first (friends ;)
- Produce an interaction workflow `Github`





### As far as I am concerned 

<div class="emphase">
    Notebook 3000
</div>

This plateform is an incredible tool 

Yet, there is some other tools:

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product)

<div class="emphase">
    Research Portefolio
</div>

Display my research outputs with a multitude of audiences
- Supervisory teams
- 

**Enhanced reproducibility**

spectrum

```{figure} Docs/Reproducibility_Spectrum.PNG
:width: 650px
source: {cite}`Peng2011`
```

- Data is accessible `zenodo` ...
- Code is interactive (`binder`), commentable (`hypotesis`), reproducible(`Github`) ...

<div class="emphase">
    Project Management
</div>



Great as a ressource to pass on for futur people involved in a project (cf Postdoc example)

<div class="emphase">
    Teaching Plateform
</div>

Collaborative?


<div class="emphase">
    Blog 2.0 - fitted for Research
</div>


Insert project description + aims (use pictures from touring way)

### For others

- Prepare tutorial to get ready for Jupyter Book
- Create a template book
- 




<p class="emphase">Empower Researchers with an <strong>Open Toolbox</strong> to <strong>Self Publish</strong></p>

## To do



## Description



## Aims

Insert here the long term plan of the project

### Other

```{note}
Create a voting system (below accademia - first page) for people to choose a subject that they want to analyse (using public or personal data ?) and to create a specific book for it. Scientific collaboration with the general public towards subjects of public interests.

Experts from different fields can collaborate towards solving the questions from the topic while producing tools for the people to perform further analysis 

- Measuring climate change,
- Biodiversite sur le bassin d'Arcachon (pour toi le JIM)
- ...
```



## Things to consider

### Semantic Web

- Resource Description Framework

[Schema.org](https://schema.org/)



## Elsewhere

### Other tools on the market

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), looks more professional, more versatil (ie R, Julia), but more complicated and code intensive, less accessible.

- [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/), various tools to make research more open:
    - to check in more details

- [Cactus](https://cactusglobal.com/)

- [Astrobetter](https://www.astrobetter.com/)

- [Open Learn Create](https://www.open.edu/openlearncreate/), create your own course material

- [PhD service.org](https://phdservices.org/), a scam ?

### Citizen Science programs

- [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org)

- [Cos4Cloud](https://cos4cloud-eosc.eu/) European project for producing Citizen science tools
    - [ISpot](https://www.ispotnature.org/)

## Bringing people onboard

### Financialy

In order to further developp this project but also because science doesn't pay much (especialy when you do it "out of the box"), it seems important to develop potential income solutions:



#### My Expenditures

```{note} Free Version
The main objective of the project is to change the mentality of the scientific community and **a free version must always be available** and favoured in most of the cases.
