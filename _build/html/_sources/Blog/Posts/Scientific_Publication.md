#### <strong>&#187; &#187;  An historical perspective</strong>

- **Review**: {cite:p}`Nwagwu2015`

```{note}
Use this to subsection the history
```

Scientific publication begin it's journey in 1665 with the [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society) with contributions from Isaac Newton, <span class="hovertext" data-hover="First woman ever published in 1787 (An account of a new comet)">Caroline Hershell</span>, Benjamin Franklin, Charles Darwin... Publication of scientific work will remain in the hand of <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Royal Society">scientific society</span> until the end of the second world war, a time when science publishers were notoriously inefficient and constantly broke, but science itself was about to enter a period of unprecedented growth resulting from <strong>government fundings</strong>. 
This is the time choosen by [Robert Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Maxwell) to enter the emerging business of scientific publication by creating the company <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Now owned by Elsevier">Pergamon Press</span>. As science was expanding, it become clear that it would need new journals to cover new areas of study, and while scientific societies argued about the boundaries of their fields, Pergamon just went to convince prominent academics that their particular fields required a new journal and install that person at the reins of it. They would then begin

<p class="emphase">Selling subscriptions to university libraries</p>

which suddenly had a lot of government money to spend. From 40 journals in 1959, Pergamon was publishing 150 titles by 1965, scientific articles became the only way science was represented, and publishers were seen as a necessary partner in the advancement of science. Maxwell had transformed the business of publishing but science remained unchanged and scientist would published their work to whichever journal was the best fit for their research area. It is in the mid 70's that *publications* became an inherent part of scientists career with the.

#### The Internet revolution

##### Arxiv

PhysicsE-print  Archive, founded by [Paul Ginsparg](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ginsparg) {cite:p}`Ginsparg1994`

<p class="emphase">This "e-print archive" began as an experimental means of circumventing recognized inadequacies of research journals</p>

##### Others e-publishing models

- {cite:p}`Swinnerton-Dyer1992`: Publishing  model  heavily  influenced  bythe  paper  model  in operation  and  based around  a centralised  server
- [to ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0098791394900345)
- {cite:p}`Odlyzko1995`: outline  model  based  on  the **interactive  and  less  formal  possibilities** of net-based publishing
- [to ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1990.tb00234.x): concerned mainly with the pre-formal communication stage  between  researchers
- [to ref](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/252900/1/harnad96.peer.review.html): elaborates  the  earlier model  to  include  a  mechanism  for  peer-review.
- {cite:p}`Ginsparg1997`: describes    theoperation  of  a  real  working  e-publishingmodel.  In  this  case  the  question  is  notwhether   it   works   (use   of   the   PhysicsE-prints  Archive  is  currently  running   ataround  70,000  connections  per  day6)  butwhether  the  implicit  model  it  embodies  isapplicable    to    other    areas    of    research.
    - It does (give example of bioarxiv, psyarxiv etc)

<h5>Publication pipeline</h5>

- Preliminary screening by journal editor
- Anonymous and private review by a very small number of individuals (2-5)

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>What is right</u></strong></h3>

<h4><strong>Peer Review</strong></h4>

Peer Review is necessary


- {cite:p}`Tennant2017`:

- [Interactive timeline](https://dgraziotin.shinyapps.io/peerreviewtimeline/)


<h4><strong>Journal template ?</strong></h4>

Very often publishing fees are justified by the employment of an army of editors that needs to be paid by the journal. Now sit down and think about it, you are actually doing the editorial job by using the journal latex template!

Good and bad:
- You know what you are going to get but:
- prevent creativity in sharing scientific content.
- Reproducibility crisis in Science. 
- Lots of redundancy

Experiments are not described efficiently in scientific papers and hence are **hardly reproducible**, especially when dealing with metastable samples (like ASW)

- Processing softwares not always shared
- Data in databases is not efficiently described and hard to extract, reprocess (give example)

Overall, Scientific work is published in a **Boring** way, even though every piece of Science is interesting.

<h5> <u>for the benefits of <strong>Journals</strong></u> </h5>

- You need to pay to publish (not always, OK, but most of the time)
- You need to pay to have access to publications.

Of course those "fees" are not paid by scientist themseleves, but rather by their institutions or funding bodies.

- Increased poverty amoung PhD students

###### Tools

- [Sherpa romeo](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/): *online resource that aggregates and analyses publisher open access policies*

Also, for me, the problem is deeper. 
- Too many journal titles, enclose researcher into very narrow fields.

<h5>The cost of Scientific publication</h5>

- [Article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08109021003676359)


<h4><strong>Promote competition vs collaboration  </strong></h4>

In the current atmosphere of highly competitive and uncertain research funding, publications are instrumental in determining how resources are distributed, who gets promoted, and in which directions research advances. This has cultivated a publish or perish mentalitywhere the focus is on maximizing the number of publications rather than on the validity and reproducibility of research findings as well as a decrease in the amount of information apportioned to each articles. ({cite:p}`Ghosh2012` copied from Intro)

<h5>Metrics</h5>

<h6>Impact Factor</h6>

Hierarchical stature of a journal is determined by the Impact factor metrics.
- Have overtaken the review process as arbiters of quality and significance of research.

- [Astronomy papers ranked](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?category=3103&page=1&total_size=89). - Sample size: 89



#### Are metrics a good indicator of paper quality

- **Review**: {cite:p}`Brembs2013`



- {cite:p}`Berghmans2003`
- {cite:p}`Tressoldi2013`
- {cite:p}`Fraley2014`
- {cite:p}`Macleod2015`

<h6>H-index</h6>

Scientist are judged by their number of publication to climb the accademic ladder. This is measured using <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Explain, h-index ...">metrics</span>.


Hence we all tend to **publish quick and numerous papers, rather than well and low number**


    
- Puts scientist away from their main mission, understanding the **bigger picture**

#### The scatter problem


    
<h4><strong>Peer Review</strong></h4>

Yes, I include the Peer Review process in this section as there is many flaws associated with it when performed in the context of commercial publications. {cite:p}`Ghosh2012` identified five of them:
- Reviewers are expected to have comprehensive expertise
- Reviewers do not have


#### Pressure to publish


### Poor reproducability

## To Add

### Wrong

- Existing Formats Are Not Tailored for Knowledge Transfer

The recent development of new media and communicative possibilities using information technology, and the need to communicate and comprehend increasing amounts of additional information such as numerical and multimedia data, make the traditional forms inadequate. Continued reliance on paper documents and their electronic shadows make it very difficult or impossible to incorporate massive amounts of data, moving images or software; there is simply no natural way to associate such ancillary information ‘into’ the traditional publication. Additionally, any software-based text mining or information extraction procedures require that paper-based information first be converted into machine-tractable form and made freely available for such mining.

- The Ever-Increasing Problem of Information Overload

Scholars have experienced information overload for more than a century {cite:p}`VICKERY1999` and the problem is just getting worse. Online access provides much better knowledge discovery and aggregation tools, but these tools struggle with the fragmentation of research communication caused by the rapid proliferation of increasingly specialized and overlapping journals, some with decreasing quality of reviewing.

- Verifying Claims and Re-using Results

Even in the rare cases where the data are part of the research communication, these are typically relegated to the status of *supplementary material*, whose format {cite:p}`Murray-Rust2008` and preservation (find citation) are inadequate. 
At present it is difficult for a scholar easily and sustainably to record the data on which the work is based in a form that others can absorb and use, and to maintain links to the associated textual publication.

Best solution is to be in charge during the whole precess!
