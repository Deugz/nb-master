# Roadmap

***

<p class="emphase2"><strong> Objectives  </strong></p>


This digital space where you have just set foot, is an **experiment** whose aim is to challenge the current *scientific publication system* by offering a creative alternative. There is a long way to go to get there though, and for the time being, it is a collection of `Jupyter Books`. They are canvas to share my research outputs and explore the tools available to make it `Findable, Accesible, Interoperable and Reusable`.

- (+) 2 others books that are not accessible (Perso and Postdoc).  





- A template, all in one for all your research need

I would like to use my thesis as a creative opportunity to produce an online **Research compendium**. This would be a **proof of concept** that publishing scientific work online is feasable and add values.

```{note}
Consider this website as an **evolving template** intended to share my **research work**.
```

### Post PhD submition


In the future I intend to pursue a Web-development course (le Wagon - 2 month)

**Coding school, le `Wagon` (inspiration Benjamin code)
- 2 month
- Needs finance (crowdsourcing ?)
- Transform the Canvas book

#### Build a community

<h5>Friends</h5>

- Involve people using the [Teaching](link) section first (friends ;)
- Produce an interaction workflow `Github`

<h5>Researchers</h5>

<h5>And beyond</h5>

```{note}
Create a voting system (below accademia - first page) for people to choose a subject that they want to analyse (using public or personal data ?) and to create a specific book for it. Scientific collaboration with the general public towards subjects of public interests.

Experts from different fields can collaborate towards solving the questions from the topic while producing tools for the people to perform further analysis 

- Measuring climate change,
- Biodiversite sur le bassin d'Arcachon (pour toi le JIM)
- ...
```

## Financial independance

In order to further developp this project but also because science doesn't pay much (especialy when you do it "out of the box"), it seems important to develop potential income solutions:



### My Expenditures

```{note} Free Version
The main objective of the project is to change the mentality of the scientific community and **a free version must always be available** and favoured in most of the cases.
