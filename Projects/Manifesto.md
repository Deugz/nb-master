<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>Outline</u></strong></h3> 

<p class="emphase"><strong>Aim </strong>: Using 21st century tools to create and sustain a constructive scientific dialogue</p>

The emergence of the internet unfolded new ways to share and discuss content of all sorts. We now have a rich ecocystem of <span class="hovertext" data-hover="def">Open source</span> projects facilitated by the <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Also called CC">Licence creative common</span> and yet, scientists are still relying on a 17th century old method to share their knowledge (scientific papers). The method evolved for centuries to become one of the most lucrative business as well as a technique enslaving scientists to the publication system (by the use of metrics and their importance in career advancement). This is perverting science. I think it is time to go forward in the way we share our research outputs and create a new system designed for <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Who are we ?">our</span> Open Science needs. 

<br>
<br>

***

<p class="emphase"><strong>How </strong>: By empowering scientists with a single plateform embeding all the necessary tools and methodologies for Open Science</p>

From all the tools mentioned on the right, the one you may be less familiar with is `Jupyter Book`. It is an open software, part of the [Project Jupyter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter), that takes a collection of <span class="hovertext" data-hover="(.ipynb)">jupyter notebooks</span>  and <span class="hovertext" data-hover="(.md)">markdown files</span>, compile them to produce a <span class="hovertext" data-hover="collection of .html file">static web-site</span>. I think I can deliver a proof of concept version of a single<strong> web-plateform </strong>designed to help researcher retake possesion of their work. *I see every piece of research like a furniture item, owing a web-site is like having a home within wich you can implement your furniture and design it according to your taste, and those of your guests.* 

<br>
<br>

***


<p class="emphase"><strong>To </strong>: Build, publish and share, beautiful publication-quality books and documents, from all your research outputs</p>


- Develop and maintain their research toolbox
- Produce, store, edit and share all their scientific notes, 
- Publish all your Research Outputs 


I think at this point it is best to show you an example: The web-site on the right is a <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html" target="blank"> Research compendium </a> produced using <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html" target="blank"> Jupyter-Book</a>. This book is part of the **Science For the People** project whose aim is to empower researcher to self-publish themselves in an open and innovative way, far from the unsustainable current publication system. This Book focus on my PhD project.

<br>
<br>

<p class="emphase"><strong>For </strong>: Providing an alternative to the current publication system</p>

<h5><strong>Target</strong></h5>

- Most usefull for PhD students (use from Start)

<p class="emphase2"><strong>My PhD </strong></p>

:::{dropdown} A difficult journey

The journey towards the completion of a PhD is long, hard and students are very often left alone to develop their skills in order to become an accomplished researcher. There is an incentive from `graduate schools` within Universities to help their student cohort but unfortunately (at least for me), this always translated into a set of administrative burden that are conterproductive. I think every student have their **own needs** and should be given the opportunity to developp their **own set of tools** to fulfill those needs. For me that that resulted in the web-site you are navigating into and that I will explain below:

- Paragraph to explain in plain text the aformentioned benefits

I guess for me, if I had to pick only one, the best advantage is the ability to take notes informaticaly. I have never been consistent in taking hand written notes, and would often leave them uncomplitted, all over the place ... a real nightmare.

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>Editorial canvas</u></strong></h3> 

I have always been frustrated by the fact that I could never play with the <strong>edition</strong> aspect of every piece of science I have been writimg. All the time I had to obey to a certain <strong>template</strong> that I never found appealing to me. Owing my own web-site give me the opportunity to be an integrant part of the edition process as it clearly is an <span class="hovertext" data-hover="a testing environment in a computer system in which new or untested software or coding can be run securely">editorial sandbox</span>.

<h4><strong>For your Research ...</strong></h4>

Write as you go along they said ... It will be fun they said ...

<p class="emphase"><strong>Markdown</strong> vs Latex or Word ?</p>

One is relatively painfull and mostly serve the purpose of fitting within scientific journal edition templates. The other however, with the help of `Jupyter Book` gives you a serie of advantages shown below:  

<h5>Benefits</h5>

- Work is publishable as you go along (or not), and you can get **feedback** at every steps during your scientific journey, and that my friend is the best to learn and have a sain PhD journey.  

- Your are your own editor, you don't have to obey any boring format. What we are doing as Researcher is great and exciting so ffs share it like that.  
    - creativity

- Choose your audience (multiple)

Overall,

- More than just a template

<h6><u>Readibility</u></h6>

Readability is the search for factors in reading material which could be easily and objectively counted.**Positivist paradigm** stated that reading difficulties is influenced by four factors, content, stylistic elements, format and organisation. Among these elements, factors such as vocabulary load, sentence structure, idea density and human interest appeared to be significantly related to reading difficulty. **Cognitive science** (date) bring a new perspective which emphasized the interactive nature of reading and the constructive nature of comprehension. Comprehension is related to the cognitive process of searching for meaning, that is no longer viewed as coming from the text, but, rather, from the readers mind in interaction with the text.

Because of its collaborative nature, and the ability to collect readers experience, I think this web-site can be a great research plateform to investigate readability, accrose the full spectrum of audiences. 

High **readibility** (process of matching the reader and the text) by allowing the readers () to navigate

This is a brief attempt to explain how **Education** works.
    
The body of the tree represent the education system. The trunk being the common set of knowledge that we are given in highschool (which is mandatory for all, as far as I know). The branches represent the University, and at that point the system diverge into different discipline, at bachelor level and subsequently when you get to do a Master. The leafs actually represent Researches that **creates new knowledge**

<h5>Presentations / Posters</h5>

- Recycle your talks ! 

Put them online and give them a quick twist to fit a wider audience.

```

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>Publication plateform</u></strong></h3>

- Publication are rattached to your own profile rather than belonging to a journal

- **Free** (no paywall)


<h4>Example</h4>

- [Formatting idea](https://www.julian.com/)

<h5>The Future</h5>

```


<h4><strong> Open for Collaboration </strong></h4>

What I would like to explore is how we can bring researchers (from various disciplines) to work together on a given problematic, rather than competing with each other. I think that such a plateform can help in promoting this **collaborative approach**.

- promote collaboration rather than competition

- L'entraide pour rendre accessible du contenue educatif de pointe, de qualite et accessible a tous!

L'emploie du ton familier (universel).

You will have to put some efforts to make it work, but you will build a tool that can follow you during your whole career. 

I think it is worth a try (link to jupyter-book tuto)

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>Communication</u></strong></h3>

    
<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/feature_comparison.png" />
    
```{note}

- reproduce with science communication methods

```

<h4><strong> Create a dialogue</strong></h4>

The most beatifull part of having your work hosted in the internet is that people (all people, cf below) can interact with it and comment, ask questions ...


````{margin} 
```{admonition} Financial support

Reaching an audience would allow the potential for financial support

```
````
- ton de la conversation
- Bienveillance

Dont la finalite n'est pa de generer de l'argent mais bien de creer le dialogue. Quand bien meme des possibilites de soutien financiere sont possibles.


<h4><strong> For All Audiences</strong></h4>

- Add span div that appear when the fish in aquarium is hovered.
- Create specific admonitions for each fish type
- Add student fish (floating on his back at surface ^^)

I am imagining a world where researchers would be <strong>free</strong> to publish their work in their own terms, far from the current commercial scientific publication system.

- Articles
- Data
- Code
- Notes
- Method
- Presentations
- Teaching
- ... 


Stored, versioned, citable (via `DOI`) and embebeded into a prebuild web-site wich gives you the abillity to link all this content together. This promote an <strong> open, transparent and lifelong peer review </strong>process with a content that can be adapted to fit multiple audiences.
