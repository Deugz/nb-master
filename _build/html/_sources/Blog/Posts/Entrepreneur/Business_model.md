:::{epigraph}

I want to create a **social entreprise** that empower researchers with a turnkey solution to self-publish their scientific work online. It is a note taking method (in markdown) relying on one open source software ([Jupyter-Book](../../../Appendix/Help/Executable-Book/Jupyter)), resulting in a multitude of benefits for researchers, all along their academic journey:
- See [How do I use online books](../../../Projects/How_do/How_do_I)

This has also a lot of potential to bring scientific public engagement to the next level, by allowing people to have direct access and interact with top class research. The global aim is to achieve a paradigm schift to break free from the commercial publication system, a parasit that feed from the academic community (cf [Manifesto](../../../Projects/Manifesto)).

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format and then **convert it to structurally valid HTML**. I came accross it during my `Python` deep dive, where I discovered that you could mix Python and Markdown using a web application called `Jupyter Notebook`. To me, that was a novice python programmer at the time, that was a game changer as I could now code in a step-by-step fashion with text cells between code cells resulting in a self explanatory program (and less frightening I must say, more in Tab B). Later I discovered that Jupyter was in fact a whole ecocystem of open source software, encompassing `Jupyter Lab`, and more importantly `Jupyter-Book`. The later is defined as a tool to: 

<br>

<p class="emphase">Build beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational content</p>

<br>

::::{grid} 2

:::{grid-item}
:columns: 9


Somehow that sounded like what I wanted to achieve with my PhD thesis, but after one year of use, I think the capabilities extend far beyond this restrictive scope. Indeed, the online format gives me a much broader type of inputs (video, podcasts, animations, hyperlinks ...) and have a potentially infinite depth. I can also test some new way of communicate science that have never been experimented before, finding my own style. 

<br>

**Competitors:** 
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/fr-fr): A great note taking, web-scrapping, knowledge base software that also allow IA. It is a good software but I don't see it as being dedicated for research purposes, at least not in the way I intend to design my plateform. It is a great source of aspiration though. 
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): I need to test it but looks like there is no build option to get a web-site and only allow md files (where jupyter book also allow .ipynb (python notebook))

Science must be **reproducibile**, and there is evidence that this is not always the case (ref). This is main reason why the FAIR Principles {cite:p}`Wilkinson2016` have been put in place, in order for the data to be:
- Findable
- Accessible
- Interoperable
- Reusable

The paper based publication model is not built for that purpose and very often this is resumed by a link towards a data repository at the end of a scientific paper. However, with my publication model, I can directly link my data and softwares within my notes and this is already a great improvment. But there is also a scope to go much further than this. Indeed, I have the possibility to make my software **interactive** and directly emebed into the web page.

The interactivity is a feature I tested, but it still need to be perfected
