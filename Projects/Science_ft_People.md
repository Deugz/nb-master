# Roadmap


This digital space where you have just set foot, is an **experiment** whose aim is to challenge the current *scientific publication system* by offering a creative alternative. There is a long way to go to get there though, and for the time being, it is a collection of `Jupyter Books`. They are canvas to share my research outputs and explore the tools available to make it `Findable, Accesible, Interoperable and Reusable`.

```{admonition} To Explore

- [OFFICE OF ASTRONOMY FOR DEVELOPMENT](https://www.astro4dev.org/collaboration-gateway/)
    - Create a collaboration

```

## Introduction

### <strong>&#187;  <u> Template </u></strong>

````{margin} 
```{warning}
Main goal is **finish my PhD**
- Deadline: **June 2023**
```
````

- A template, all in one for all your research need

I would like to use my thesis as a creative opportunity to produce an online **Research compendium**. This would be a **proof of concept** that publishing scientific work online is feasable and add values.

```{note}
Consider this website as an **evolving template** intended to share my **research work**.
```
### Workflow

To produce and publish my work online, I come accross a wide range of tools: 

#### Tools

Science is all about **Data**. Every scientific project involved the generation and interpretation of one or multiple datasets. They can be of many types and shape ...


````{margin}
```{note}
- I guess the next step on this diagram is **Collaboration**
    - cf next page
```

Version control

::::

I think the first thing to achieve is go through the many obstacles necessary to overcome for publishing a **Research Compendium** online. This imply a lot of learning, and I intend to make sure that I implement somewhere the problems / solutions I found along the way to facilitate the process for any other interested individual. 

<h5>To consider</h5>

- Semantic web workflow
- Knowledge graph


#### PhD

In the same fashion than previously described, I use my PhD work to implement the content I generate into various pages and trying to generate a self-contained structure.

### Present and until PhD submission

<p class="emphase">Finish the Thesis</p>

Is the main **goal**, and there is still a lot to do

- Data Reduction (link notebook) 
- Data Processing
- ...

I am planning to write my thesis in Word but during the final year of my PhD, I will keep populating this web-site with my research outputs and use it as a tool to discus the results with my supervision team (and collaborators).

This web-site can Help! (cf benefices section in PhD page - (make link))

<p class="emphase">Notebook and supervision</p>

Notes are taken using `markdown` within the PhD folder and are uploaded weekly on Github, prior to my meeting with Anita

**Supervisory team needs to be involved for Peer Review** (Agreed!). 

- Innovative approach
- Continuous feedback workflow
- Open, inclusive ...
- Easy and fun!

#### Benefits

```{note}
Include PhD  benefits section
```


<p class="emphase">Sprinkle the Teaching material</p>

Unfolding a Research question requires diving into a lot of complex scientific topics and I will sprinkle the [Teaching](Teaching pages) as I go along. However, the ariane thread related to planet formation span across multiple Scientific fields. For example, I study the formation of planets from a *bottom-up* approach, taking the initial material present in protoplanetary disks, interstellar dust grains and understand how they aggregate to form bigger bodies and eventually planets. Other Scientists take the opposite approach, recovering meteorites and studying them to understand where do they come frome and what is their formation history (top to bottom). Even though we are trying to solve the same question, our background knowledge, investigation techniques and basic language is completely different and it makes it hard sometimes to understand each others.       

<p class="emphase">Community building</p>

Idealy I would like to build a community like those ones:

- [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/)
    - [Pythia project](https://projectpythia.org/)
    
- [Ncar](https://ncar.ucar.edu/)





## Project aims



## Futur 

### Post PhD submition


In the future I intend to pursue a Web-development course (le Wagon - 2 month)

**Coding school, le `Wagon` (inspiration Benjamin code)
- 2 month
- Needs finance (crowdsourcing ?)
- Transform the Canvas book

#### Build a community

<h5>Friends</h5>

- Involve people using the [Teaching](link) section first (friends ;)
- Produce an interaction workflow `Github`

<h5>Researchers</h5>

<h5>And beyond</h5>

```{note}
Create a voting system (below accademia - first page) for people to choose a subject that they want to analyse (using public or personal data ?) and to create a specific book for it. Scientific collaboration with the general public towards subjects of public interests.

Experts from different fields can collaborate towards solving the questions from the topic while producing tools for the people to perform further analysis 

- Measuring climate change,
- Biodiversite sur le bassin d'Arcachon (pour toi le JIM)
- ...
```


### As far as I am concerned 

<div class="emphase">
    Notebook 3000
</div>

This plateform is an incredible tool 

Yet, there is some other tools:

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product)

<div class="emphase">
    Research Portefolio
</div>

Display my research outputs with a multitude of audiences
- Supervisory teams
- 

**Enhanced reproducibility**

spectrum

```{figure} Docs/Reproducibility_Spectrum.PNG
:width: 650px
source: {cite}`Peng2011`
```

- Data is accessible `zenodo` ...
- Code is interactive (`binder`), commentable (`hypotesis`), reproducible(`Github`) ...

<div class="emphase">
    Project Management
</div>



Great as a ressource to pass on for futur people involved in a project (cf Postdoc example)

<div class="emphase">
    Teaching Plateform
</div>

Collaborative?


<div class="emphase">
    Blog 2.0 - fitted for Research
</div>


Insert project description + aims (use pictures from touring way)

### For others

- Prepare tutorial to get ready for Jupyter Book
- Create a template book
-

## Elsewhere

### Other tools on the market

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), looks more professional, more versatil (ie R, Julia), but more complicated and code intensive, less accessible.

- [OurResearch](https://ourresearch.org/), various tools to make research more open:
    - to check in more details

- [Astrobetter](https://www.astrobetter.com/)

- [Open Learn Create](https://www.open.edu/openlearncreate/), create your own course material

## Financial independance

In order to further developp this project but also because science doesn't pay much (especialy when you do it "out of the box"), it seems important to develop potential income solutions:



### My Expenditures

```{note} Free Version
The main objective of the project is to change the mentality of the scientific community and **a free version must always be available** and favoured in most of the cases.
