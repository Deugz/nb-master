### Why ?

```{note}

Insert paragraphe about difficulties to take notes.

```

A method to take, store, edit and display my notes informatically allowing incrementall implementation. It includes all the requirements of scientific publishing: 

- Bibliography 
- References
    - Figures
    - Tables
    - Equations
- Links and hyperlink ...

### How ?

<p class="emphase2"> Markdown </p>


<p class="emphase2"> Jupyter Lab </p>


```{note}

Insert a picture of the working environment (all in one)
- **Python** notebook and **Markdown** notebook using the **same software**

```

##  Storage  

Web-sites require a solid folder architecture to work (ie links ...). So does a PhD with considerable amounts of data, scripts, files, notes, reports ... Stored localy (Hardrive) and exported periodicly on Github for Version control and web hosting. Symbiosis relationship.

### Local
