## How it works

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>An historical perspective</u></strong></h3>

Scientific publication begin it's journey in 1665 with the [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society) with contributions from Isaac Newton, <span class="hovertext" data-hover="First woman ever published in 1787 (An account of a new comet)">Caroline Hershell</span>, Benjamin Franklin, Charles Darwin... Publication of scientific work will remain in the hand of <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Royal Society">scientific society</span> until the end of the second world war, a time when science publishers were notoriously inefficient and constantly broke, but science itself was about to enter a period of unprecedented growth resulting from <strong>government fundings</strong>. 
This is the time choosen by [Robert Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Maxwell) to enter the emerging business of scientific publication by creating the company <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Now owned by Elsevier">Pergamon Press</span>. As science was expanding, it become clear that it would need new journals to cover new areas of study, and while scientific societies argued about the boundaries of their fields, Pergamon just went to convince prominent academics that their particular fields required a new journal and install that person at the reins of it. They would then begin

<p class="emphase">Selling subscriptions to university libraries</p>

which suddenly had a lot of government money to spend. From 40 journals in 1959, Pergamon was publishing 150 titles by 1965, scientific articles became the only way science was represented, and publishers were seen as a necessary partner in the advancement of science. Maxwell had transformed the business of publishing but science remained unchanged and scientist would published their work to whichever journal was the best fit for their research area. It is in the mid 70's that *publications* became an inherent part of scientists career with the

<h5>Publication pipeline</h5>

- Preliminary screening by journal editor
- Anonymous and private review by a very small number of individuals (2-5)

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>What is right</u></strong></h3>

<h4><strong>Peer Review</strong></h4>

Peer Review is necessary


<h4><strong>Journal template ?</strong></h4>

Very often publishing fees are justified by the employment of an army of editors that needs to be paid by the journal. Now sit down and think about it, you are actually doing the editorial job by using the journal latex template!

Good and bad:
- You know what you are going to get but:
- prevent creativity in sharing scientific content.
- Reproducibility crisis in Science. 
- Lots of redundancy

Experiments are not described efficiently in scientific papers and hence are **hardly reproducible**, especially when dealing with metastable samples (like ASW)

- Processing softwares not always shared
- Data in databases is not efficiently described and hard to extract, reprocess (give example)

Overall, Scientific work is published in a **Boring** way, even though every piece of Science is interesting.





<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>What is wrong</u></strong></h3>



<h4><strong>Monetisation of knowledge </strong></h4>

:::::{div} full-width

::::{grid} 2

<div>

<h5> <u>for the benefits of <strong>Journals</strong></u> </h5>

- You need to pay to publish (not always, OK, but most of the time)
- You need to pay to have access to publications.

Of course those "fees" are not paid by scientist themseleves, but rather by their institutions or funding bodies. 

</div>
    

<div>
    
<h5> <u>to the detriment of <strong>Researchers</strong></u> </h5>

Interstingly, while I am writing those lines along with wrapping up my PhD thesis, **I am not paid by my institution** - Pretty cruel system don't you think ?

- Increased poverty amoung PhD students
- slavery ...

Doesn't really matt]er because we are passionate about what we do right ?

Well passion doesn't bring food in the table.

<h5> <u>Open Access</u> </h5>

Yes, some journals offers Open Access, but very often it is a costly options as you need to pay <span class="hovertext" data-hover="How is this money spend, I don't know">Article Processing Charges</span> (APC).
For Nature they cost 9500 Euros !! (source: <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/open-access" target="blank">Here</a>) 

###### Tools

- [Sherpa romeo](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/): *online resource that aggregates and analyses publisher open access policies*

Also, for me, the problem is deeper. 
- Too many journal titles, enclose researcher into very narrow fields.

- Astro thesaurus example, many subfields but is there a need for as many journal

<h5>The cost of Scientific publication</h5>

- [Article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08109021003676359)


<h4><strong>Promote competition vs collaboration  </strong></h4>

In the current atmosphere of highly competitive and uncertain research funding, publications are instrumental in determining how resources are distributed, who gets promoted, and in which directions research advances. This has cultivated a publish or perish mentalitywhere the focus is on maximizing the number of publications rather than on the validity and reproducibility of research findings as well as a decrease in the amount of information apportioned to each articles. ({cite:p}`Ghosh2012` copied from Intro)

<h5>Metrics</h5>

<h6>Impact Factor</h6>

Hierarchical stature of a journal is determined by the Impact factor metrics.
- Have overtaken the review process as arbiters of quality and significance of research.

- [Astronomy papers ranked](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?category=3103&page=1&total_size=89). - Sample size: 89


<h6>H-index</h6>

Scientist are judged by their number of publication to climb the accademic ladder. This is measured using <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Explain, h-index ...">metrics</span>.


Hence we all tend to **publish quick and numerous papers, rather than well and low number**


    
- Puts scientist away from their main mission, understanding the **bigger picture**
    
<h4><strong>Peer Review</strong></h4>

Yes, I include the Peer Review process in this section as there is many flaws associated with it when performed in the context of commercial publications. {cite:p}`Ghosh2012` identified five of them:
- Reviewers are expected to have comprehensive expertise
- Reviewers do not have



## Can we do better ?

I am not the first one that have been asking this question

- [Special issue in frontier](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/137/beyond-open-access-visions-for-open-evaluation-of-scientific-papers-by-post-publication-peer-review#articles)

Below is a selection of a few articles from this special issue



- Is the terrain favorable ?
    - Are researcher agreeing that a new method is necessary ?
