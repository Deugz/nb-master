> Ah Thesis reglementation 

> I have not found any precision about what is meant by book in the *Research Degree Regulations*, hence I went to look for a definition in the Oxford dictionary where it is said that:


> It is stipulated that a non-book component can be included. As a result I think I should be allowed to publish a thesis that is 100% online


> It is stipulated in the regulation that a pdf copy has to be submitted. This is the only sentence that is preventing me to submit my thesis as a web-site ... It doesn't look like much, considering all the benefits that could arise from such a way to publish, and yet I have been told this is incredibely complicated to change. This is how far we are from progress.
