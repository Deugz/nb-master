<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>Outline</u></strong></h3> 

<p class="emphase"><strong>Aim </strong>: Using 21st century tools to create and sustain a constructive scientific dialogue</p>

The emergence of the internet unfolded new ways to share and discuss content of all sorts. We now have a rich ecocystem of <span class="hovertext" data-hover="def">Open source</span> projects facilitated by the <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Also called CC">Licence creative common</span> and yet, scientists are still relying on a 17th century old method to share their knowledge (scientific papers). The method evolved for centuries to become one of the most lucrative business as well as a technique enslaving scientists to the publication system (by the use of metrics and their importance in career advancement). This is perverting science. I think it is time to go forward in the way we share our research outputs and create a new system designed for <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Who are we ?">our</span> Open Science needs. 

<br>
<br>

***

<p class="emphase"><strong>How </strong>: By empowering scientists with a single plateform embeding all the necessary tools and methodologies for Open Science</p>

From all the tools mentioned on the right, the one you may be less familiar with is `Jupyter Book`. It is an open software, part of the [Project Jupyter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter), that takes a collection of <span class="hovertext" data-hover="(.ipynb)">jupyter notebooks</span>  and <span class="hovertext" data-hover="(.md)">markdown files</span>, compile them to produce a <span class="hovertext" data-hover="collection of .html file">static web-site</span>. I think I can deliver a proof of concept version of a single<strong> web-plateform </strong>designed to help researcher retake possesion of their work. *I see every piece of research like a furniture item, owing a web-site is like having a home within wich you can implement your furniture and design it according to your taste, and those of your guests.* 

<br>
<br>

***


<p class="emphase"><strong>To </strong>: Build, publish and share, beautiful publication-quality books and documents, from all your research outputs</p>


- Develop and maintain their research toolbox
- Produce, store, edit and share all their scientific notes, 
- Publish all your Research Outputs 


I think at this point it is best to show you an example: The web-site on the right is a <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html" target="blank"> Research compendium </a> produced using <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html" target="blank"> Jupyter-Book</a>. This book is part of the **Science For the People** project whose aim is to empower researcher to self-publish themselves in an open and innovative way, far from the unsustainable current publication system. This Book focus on my PhD project.

<br>
<br>

***

<p class="emphase"><strong>For </strong>: Providing an alternative to the current publication system</p>

<h5><strong>Target</strong></h5>

- Most usefull for PhD students (use from Start)
- Adaptable to individual needs    

- multiscale</strong>

<p class="emphase2"><strong>My PhD </strong></p>

:::{dropdown} A difficult journey

The journey towards the completion of a PhD is long, hard and students are very often left alone to develop their skills in order to become an accomplished researcher. There is an incentive from `graduate schools` within Universities to help their student cohort but unfortunately (at least for me), this always translated into a set of administrative burden that are conterproductive. I think every student have their **own needs** and should be given the opportunity to developp their **own set of tools** to fulfill those needs. For me that that resulted in the web-site you are navigating into and that I will explain below:

## Describe the new model


## Is it feasable 

### Technical aspect


### Community acceptance

<p class="emphase"> The introduction of a single innovation in technology cannot be successful until it is accompanied by an appropriate set of social, behavioural, organisational, and institutional   innovations.</p>

- {cite:p}`Goldhar1977`


### Funding  

#### Externaly funded

Learned societies, university ...


- pros

money

- cons

loss of independance

#### Sponsorship ?



#### Subscription model

No (need to be freely accessible to everyone)
