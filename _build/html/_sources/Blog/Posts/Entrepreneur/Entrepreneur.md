I use this page to take notes from the above OU course

As a scientist I fall into the broad category of **knowledge workers**.

## The Big Idea(s)

:::{div} full-width

<p class="emphase">I want to self-publish the outputs of my research, online.</p>

<p class="emphase">I want those outputs to be open, transparent, interactive, reproducible ...</p>

<p class="emphase">I want to be the owner of my work, and have the freedom to use any template, format of my choice and be in charge of the edition process.</p>

<p class="emphase"> To achieve the aformentioned goals, I am exploiting a bundle of open-source tools and open science practices. </p>
    
<p class="emphase">I want to developp guidelines and tutorials to help like-minded researchers to do the same.</p>

<p class="emphase">I want to create a new scientific publication model.</p>
